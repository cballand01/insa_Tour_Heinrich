            An isolated working demo is required in order to analyze this issue.
            You can easily create a demo on Codepen/JSFiddle/StackBlitz by clicking the buttons on the top of every example in the documentation.

            **Why this is important:**
            - I do not have the time to reproduce every test case from scratch
            - your bug might be related to your own application and not Photo Sphere Viewer (thus I will be unable to reproduce it)
            - taking the time to create a demo yourself allows to take a step back and find the solution yourself

            **DO'S and DON'TS:**
            - DON'T use minified source files in your demo
            - DON'T share your code inside a ZIP, I will only look at online demos
            - DO isolate the viewer from the rest of the app, if possible
            - DO describe the step-by-step workflow to reproduce the issue
